Almost done. Problem is that the index is off by 1. the first element has an index of 1 instead of 0 and it's screwing up the ability to delete the correct objects.

check near items.js by line 58 ( getselecteditem )







stopped at: 11:49 on the 2nd video in project

The app appears to stop working in readItem.js  either att offscreenWindow.loadURL()  or offscreenWindow.webContents.on('did-finish-load')

It never logs the message in that function., and neve cleans up.

https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents  claims that contents.loadURL returns a PROMISE..

which according to the promise docs on MDN i should be able log out via


  offscreenWindow.loadURL(url).then((msg) => {
    console.log("waaaat");
  })

but that doesn't work.


the problem was two things.  1.  invalid URL. the webContents.capturePage required a valid url

2. the capturePage needed a promise, not a callback
